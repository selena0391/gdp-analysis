
gdp-analysis

[quick description of your code]
I've created two functions to calculate highest and lowest GDP within states and return the names of these states. I also declared a function that allows to retreive GDP number with state, name and year parameters. I created two csv files "highest_gdp.csv" and "lowest_gdp.csv". These allow to see which states have highest and lowest gdp through years. I created a function to calculate percentage of change between two years.

Results

New York GDP dropped on 73216.0 from 2019 to 2020, which was influenced by pandemic. We can observe similar changes for all states.
